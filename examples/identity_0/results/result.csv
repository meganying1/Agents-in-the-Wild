Okay, the user is asking me to describe who I am in a few sentences. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to recall my capabilities. I'm an AI assistant designed to help with tasks using code and tools. I can execute Python code, access certain functions like web search or Wikipedia, and provide answers based on that. But wait, the tools available here are limited. The user mentioned specific tools like search_by_material, but in the previous examples, other tools like web_search or wikipedia_search were used. However, in the current task, the user is asking for a general description, not a specific query that requires tool usage.

Wait, the user's instruction says to use the tools provided. But in this case, the task is to explain who I am, which is more of a general knowledge question. However, the tools available here are search_by_material and final_answer. But the search_by_material is for searching material properties, which isn't relevant here. The other tool is final_answer, which is for providing the answer. But how do I get the information to put into final_answer?

Wait, maybe I need to use the web_search tool to find information about myself. But the user hasn't provided a web_search function in the tools list. Looking back, the tools available are:

def final_answer(answer: any) -> any:
    """"""Provides a final answer to the given problem.""""""

def search_by_material(material: string) -> any:
    """"""
        Search a material database for a material to find its properties.
    

    Args:
        material: The material to search for.
    """"""

So, the only tools available are final_answer and search_by_material. But search_by_material is for materials, not for general information. Therefore, I can't use any tool to search for information about myself. So, how do I answer the question?

Wait, the user is asking me to tell them who I am. Since I'm an AI assistant, I can answer that I am an AI assistant designed to help with tasks using code and tools. But since the tools available are limited, maybe I need to use the final_answer function directly. But the problem is that I don't have access to external information, so I have to rely on my own knowledge.

So, the answer would be that I am an AI assistant created to assist with tasks, using code and the available tools. Since there's no tool to search for information, I can't perform a web search. Therefore, I"
