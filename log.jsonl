Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up!

Let's compute the result using Python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove examples were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef add_numbers(a: number, b: number) -> number:\n    \"\"\"Adds two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a: First number\n        b: Second number\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use Python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up!
